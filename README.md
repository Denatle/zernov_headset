## About
Hey! This is my own code for creating an AR/MR helmet based on Linux and Python. In Python, this thing uses MediaPipe and Cv2 for video streams.
I started it only something like 2 month ago, so it not so good
Biggest framerate you can get at this code is around 30, so you should use NASA supercomputer, I think.

# Let's start!

Before running this code you should install all dependency, so you can use (requirements)[requirements.txt] for that:

```pip
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
